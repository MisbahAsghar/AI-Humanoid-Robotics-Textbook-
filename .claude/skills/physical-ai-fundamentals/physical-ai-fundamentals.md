# Physical AI Fundamentals

## Purpose
Guide users through the foundational concepts of Physical AI, including embodied intelligence, the sensor-motor loop, and real-time constraints that differentiate physical robots from traditional AI systems.

## When to Use
- Starting a new Physical AI or robotics project
- Understanding why physical systems differ from software-only AI
- Learning about latency requirements and power constraints
- Grasping the reality gap between simulation and deployment

## Book Chapters
- Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics

## Example Usage
```
User: "Help me understand the key differences between Physical AI and traditional AI"

Claude: Using the physical-ai-fundamentals skill, I'll reference Chapter 1 which explains:

1. Embodied Intelligence: Physical AI systems must sense and act in the real world, not just process data
2. Sensor-Motor Loop: The continuous cycle of sense → perceive → decide → act
3. Real-time Constraints: Control loops require 2-10ms response times for balance
4. Safety Requirements: Physical failures can cause harm, requiring redundancy

See Chapter 1, Section 1.3 for detailed comparisons and examples.
